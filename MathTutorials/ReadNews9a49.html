		<div class="News_Read_Head">Hurricane Ike!!</div>
		<div class="News_Read_Item">Well Hurricane Ike moved through here last Friday and I think it caught a lot of people a little off guard.  We were quite a way from the center of the storm but we were in the northeast quadrant (the worst one to be in on a hurricane) and suffered extensive damage.  I think we all new we were in for a rough ride, but just not to the extent that it ended up being.....</p>

<p>Beaumont (where Lamar University and the server is located) didn't have anywhere near as much damage as Bolivar Peninsula, Crystal Beach or Bridge City suffered, but we still saw pretty extensive damage.

<p>The folks down here to help us recover have done an amazing job at getting us back on our feet.  Most are still without power but they got the University up and running much quicker than they did after Hurricane Rita hit here 3 years ago (and I mean almost literally 3 years ago - only off by a couple of weeks...) so it looks like we're on the road to recovery!</p>

<p>Gas and food are still a little hard to find down here but if you were properly prepared (luckily I was as I had enough food and water for a week or so) you should be okay for a few more days and by then the situation should be much better.</p>

Anyway, the site is back up and hopefully there won't be any interuptions but please be aware that it is completely possible that they will need to power down the grid a few times as they work to restore power to everyone.  That did happen a few times after Hurricane Rita so I'm expecting it to happen here as well at least a few times.  In those cases I'll work to get the site back up as soon as I can and I really do apologize for the inconvience all this has caused.</p>
